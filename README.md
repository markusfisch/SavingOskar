# Saving Oskar

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markusfisch/SavingOskar/gh-pages/screenshot.png" alt="screenshot"/>

A game about a lamb called Oskar for [Ludum Dare][ldjam] #43
"Sacrifices must be made".

Made by [Christian Braun][chris] and me.
Christian made all the art.

The gods demand a sacrifice and so a lamb must die.
But not Oskar, your dear friend.
You must try and kill another lamb to save Oskar.

Use the cursor keys to walk and hit space to use your knife.

Play it [here][here].
